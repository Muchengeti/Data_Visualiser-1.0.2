Create epics for next tasks

Background
Research viability of portable app


Jobs at ecs for domain questions - added to ecs domain / might take 1 or 2 weeks to set up ( go bakc ot them if no reply for a week)

Make sure you focus on swen design elements of projects not just adding the features ive been asked - given this that challenge of trying to decouple the graphing could be good for allowing me to design a solution and compare it against the existing / implement it, given it doesnâ€™t break the existing project
