Date: Wednesday 27th May
Attendees: Muchengeti Matinde

I expressed my desire to find a task to replace the usb promotional tool which was the reason for the meeting.
I was concered after talking to Ramesh and Jens that many of the tasks in the project are standalone and do not require application of a development process
of planning and designing. This meeting was to try group/build some of these smaller task into one where I could apply this process. 


Putting something in 2 windows is trivial - you could just put two iframes/embeds together

Understand importance of finishing something

Stuart just wants delivery but there needs to be space for me to develop and design
Recognises time is limited 

Potential Replacements for USB promotional tool

ONE
Digging down into data (need to parse data into a different way)
Concern over how long this would take
You want to pull more data from figshare (you modify to collect more data)
Linked to datasets behind 
Stuart doesnt believe it can be done in time by myself

TWO
Replacing graphing engine
Stuart suggests plotly 
Would need to try upgrade minors and see if engine change would help if you canâ€™t make changes

THREE
make little changes to graph to make it publication quality



FOUR
Display analytics on page

FIVE
User interface modification
Try rip out control panel
Start from scratch
Must reach same functionality otherwise work cannot be used (risk of not being able to complete this on time meaning entire feature will not be used)
Graph colour options
Add embed code button in export
Provide link to figshare datasets (not just link from figshare logo)

Additional ideas will come once we keep developing
Widget shows close control panel through button

Stuart will use each tag version as deliverable

I expressed option five would be my preference and would deliver a lot of value to the users who expressed many complaints about poor usability due to the un intuitive control panel.
It seems it may require re-doing the system implemented by the previous team

Action Points

* Plan this second epic (look at previous implentation/design new control panel)
* Email Stuart basic outline of outcomes/planned work for this epic
* Email Ramesh to update him on scope change
