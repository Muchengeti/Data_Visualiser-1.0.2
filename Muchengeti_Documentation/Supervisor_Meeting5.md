Meeting 5
Attendees: Muchengeti Matinde, Jens Deitrich, Stuart Wimbush

Talking points:

Jens will be my new technical supervisor and the meeting was to get him up to speed on what the project outcomes are and what the existing state of the application is. The meeting helped clear up the decoupling aspect of the project which I had previously been thinking would involve building an API to use graphing on other webpages but what I should be investigating is the use of Embedded links. This was an issue with my lack of technical terminology leading me down the wrong path. Moving forward it will be helpful having Jens for consultation with all software related questions / issues i run into. 

Action Points
Rephrase focus of decoupling to allowing embedded links for graphing
Research using usb as local server
Research embedded links 
Email Ramesh to organise a group meeting between Stuart, Ramesh and I (and Jens if needed)
