Point Enabled:

You can use the iframe embed with dataset url to embed on any html page

A default embed code is only 1 line long - parameters extend it to 2 which is still very short

You are able to set the default parameters for the embedded chart

This is done using url query arguments in the url - doing this in the url allows the code to remain very small/short as oppossed as passing the parameters in as seperate custom arugments to a script

A current bug is that the button highlights do not reflect custom default chart parameters - this is because they are using hardcoded default values initially which I aim to change to be done dynamically if not just left undefined

can give basic html page i used to test and ip to reach the app for you to test it yourself and track progress

Next Point:
Get buttons to highlist initial customer defaults

Enable custom defaults for X dependency and selected Y axis value type

Display default embed code of the dataset on the page for copy

Stuarts Notes: 

Could just use main graph screen and hide control panel - this is acceptable

Not concerned about readability of parameters - doesnt need to be bulletproof

have all parameters then they can go through and take them away
