  <h3>
    The Robinson Research Institute high-temperature superconducting wire critical current database
  </h3>
  <p>
    This database comprises high temperature superconducting wire performance data measured at the Robinson Research
    Institute of Victoria University of Wellington. Its principal focus is on commercially available materials, and it aims
    to provide the most comprehensive data available, enabling informed materials selection and the efficient
    modelling, design and construction of high temperature superconducting machines and devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    The database will continue to be expanded over time, and submissions of additional (commercially-available) materials
    for measurement and potential inclusion in the database <a href="mailto:rri-admin@vuw.ac.nz?subject=RRI HTS wire critical current database" class="footer-text">
    are welcomed.

  <h4>
    About the measurements
  </h4>
  <p>
    Superconductor characterisation data is acquired on our in-house SuperCurrent ùòêc measurement system. This system facilitates
    measurements of critical currents up to 1000 A at temperatures down to 15 K and in magnetic fields up to 8 T. A description
    of the system can be found in N. M. Strickland, C. Hoffmann, and S. C. Wimbush,<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4902139"><i>
    A 1 kA-class cryogen-free critical current characterization system for superconducting coated conductors</i></a>, Rev. Sci. Instrum.
    85 (2014) 113907.

  <h4>About the data</h4>
  <p>
    Complete datasets are stored on <a href="https://figshare.com/collections/A_high_temperature_superconducting_HTS_wire_critical_current_database/2861821">
    figshare</a>, where they are publicly accessible in their entirety. Each dataset is a comprehensive characterisation of the
    performance of a particular sample wire over a wide range of potential operating conditions of temperature, magnetic field,
    and field angle. Data can be viewed in terms of the absolute critical current of the wire, or normalised to its width. ùòØ-value
    data is also available. The database is described in S. C. Wimbush and
    N. M. Strickland, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2016.2628700"><i>A public database of high-temperature superconductor critical current data</i></a>, IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond. 27
    (2017) 8000105.

  <h4>About the data visualiser</h4>
  <p>
    This data visualiser provides a means of direct graphical access to the wire performance datasets. Desired performance curves can
    be accessed and exported for further use. The latest datasets are automatically sourced from the underlying figshare database.
